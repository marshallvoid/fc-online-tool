```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd fconline

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install development dependencies (optional)
uv sync --group dev

# Install Playwright browsers (required)
uv run playwright install chromium

# Setup pre-commit hooks (optional)
uv run pre-commit install
```

#### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd fc-online

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install Playwright browsers (required)

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Event Configuration

All event configurations are defined in `src/utils/contants.py` and can be customized for different events or updated selectors.

## üîß Development

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install all development dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Code formatting
uv run black src/
uv run ruff format

# Linting
uv run ruff check src/
uv run flake8 src/

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Import sorting
uv run isort src/

# Run all pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üì¶ Building

### Quick Build

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./build.sh

# Windows
build.bat
```

### Manual Build

```bash
# Install build dependencies
uv sync --group build

# Create executable
uv run pyinstaller build.spec

# Clean build artifacts (optional)
rm -rf build/ dist/ __pycache__/ src/__pycache__/ src/*/__pycache__/ src/*/*/__pycache__/
```

The build process creates a standalone executable with embedded Python runtime and all dependencies.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**

   ```bash
   # Ensure all dependencies are installed
   uv sync
   uv run playwright install chromium

   # Clean and rebuild
   rm -rf build/ dist/
   uv run pyinstaller build.spec
   ```
